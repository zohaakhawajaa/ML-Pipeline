# ML-Pipeline
Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for customer churn prediction using Scikit-learn Pipeline API. Implemented preprocessing, trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, tuned hyperparameters with GridSearchCV, and exported the final pipeline using joblib for production reuse.
